    <strong>Interpretation</strong>

<p>
    <strong>Exclusions</strong>

    Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the
    exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental
    damages, so the limitations above may not apply to you.

    held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of
    these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire
    agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any
    prior agreements we might have had between us regarding the Service.
