<p>
1. Hello and welcome! Glad to have you on board. When we say ‘<strong>we</strong>’, ‘<strong>us</strong>’, ‘<strong>R script Market</strong>’ or ‘    <strong>Vaionex</strong>’, it’s because that’s who we are and we own and run the <strong>RScript Market</strong> site.
</p>
<p>
    2. RScript Market’s digital marketplace helps people around the world get creative and earn online. When you create an account and accept these terms you
become a <strong>member</strong> of our community. You will have an <strong>RScript Market account</strong> that will allow you to buy and sell    <strong>items</strong> like the ones found on the RScript Market site and make other related transactions.
</p>
<p>
    3. The RScript Market sites are platforms that allow members to buy and sell licenses to use digital items like software codes and files. On RScript
    Market, buyers and authors (sellers) transact with each other directly and we provide the platform to allow the transactions to happen. Any transactions
    are logged on your member’s statement, which records the payments made by you to authors via RScript Market (as a <strong>buyer</strong>) and by buyers via
    RScript Market to you (as an <strong>author</strong>).
</p>
<p>
    4. The items on RScript Market are owned by the authors, not by us. We provide a platform; we do not take ownership of the items.
</p>
<p>
    5. During your time with us you agree to follow the ground rules outlined in these terms so please read and understand them. If you don’t accept the terms
    then we’ll be sad, but you will need to leave because your presence on and use of the RScript Market sites is conditional on your acceptance to be bound by
    these terms and the <a href="https://envato.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> whether you become a member or not.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>How browsing and membership works</strong>
</p>
<p>
    6. <strong>Browsing</strong>: You need to be 13 years or over to browse the RScript Market site. We don’t knowingly collect any information from anyone
    aged 13 or under. When browsing the site you agree to follow our guidelines or instructions and keep in mind that these terms apply to any use of our
    RScript Market site whether or not you’re a member.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Membership</strong>
</p>
<p>
    7. <strong>Age</strong>: You need to be 18 years or over to become a member. If you’re under 18 you will need to use the account of a parent or legal
    guardian who is at least 18 years of age, with their permission, and this adult will be responsible for all your activities.
</p>
<p>
    8. <strong>Benefits</strong>: Membership is free. When you become a member you get an RScript Market account that is accessible from any of our RScript
    Market site (and is also your RScript account for other RScript services). Your membership will allow you to ‘buy’ (license) items from authors,
    participate in our online forums, and generally contribute to our ecosystem of RScript Market site that help people get creative. Membership also gives you
    the opportunity to become an author (see <strong>section 30 – Becoming an Author</strong>).
</p>
<p>
    9. <strong>Your responsibility</strong>: You promise that information you give us is true, accurate and complete and that you will keep your account
    information up-to-date (including a current email address). Your membership is not transferrable. You are responsible for any use of the RScript Market
    site that occurs in conjunction with your username and password so keep your password secure and don’t let any other person use your username or password.
    If you realise there’s any unauthorized use of your password or any breach of security you need to let us know immediately.
</p>
<p>
    It is important that you understand your responsibilities as a member of our community so please take the time to review this section and the RScript
    Market Terms carefully.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>How buying items works</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This section will help you understand what you are buying when you purchase an item and how that transaction takes place on RScript Market.
</p>
<p>
    11. <strong>What you're buying:</strong>
</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
    <li>
        <strong>License</strong>
        : When you <strong>buy</strong> an item, you acquire the right to use that item; you're not actually acquiring the item itself. What you get includes a
        license directly from the author to use that item. Items are subject to specific terms of use, and these terms are the ‘license’ that we set on RScript
        Market. This license also applies to you if you download an item that someone else has bought for you (because anyone downloading an item needs to be
        an RScript Market member). Different license types are available for you to choose when you have selected an item. You’ll need to think about the way
        you want to use the item so that you can pick the right license to allow that use. It’s your responsibility to choose the correct license.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Item support</strong>
        : Authors can choose whether or not to support certain items. If an author chooses to support an item, this will be identified on the item page. All
        supported items include a support period. You can buy support extensions on these items.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
To learn more about item support, like what items are covered, what authors provide, the support period and support extension options, see the    <u>item support policy</u>.
</p>
<ol start="3" type="a">
    <li>
        <strong>Buyer services</strong>
        : When you ‘buy’ an item you also receive services from RScript Market like 24/7 buyer support, fraud protection, item quality control and other
        related buyer services.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    12. The total price for an item on RScript Market is made up of:
</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
    <li>
        <strong>Item price</strong>
        : The item price is made up of a license fee (for the license you choose for the item), and if relevant the item support fee (for supported items).
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Buyer fee</strong>
        : This is the fee for the buyer services you get from RScript Market
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Handling fee</strong>
        : In some transactions on RScript Market the total price may include a handling fee. See <strong>section 17</strong> for the details about the handling
        fee.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Taxes</strong>
        : Some transactions on RScript Market may be subject to tax that may be added to the list price or handling fee. See <strong>section 22</strong> for
        details about taxes on RScript Market.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    The <strong>list price</strong> is made up of the item price and buyer fee, and is the price you see on an item page.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Transacting as a buyer:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    13. You can make payments in one of two ways: you can ‘Buy Now’ via your RScript Market account.
</p>
<p>
    14. If you choose to <strong>Buy Now</strong> you will be redirected to a <strong>payment method</strong> provider. You may be required to pay a handling
    fee charged over the item price.
</p>
<p>
    18. <strong>Currency conversion costs</strong>: You are responsible for all costs of currency conversion relating to your RScript Market account. Your
    financial institution does the currency conversion and may charge you additional fees (we don’t control either the conversion rates or your financial
    institution’s fees).
</p>
<p>
    This means that you may incur additional costs when purchasing from RScript Market, which we have no control over.
</p>
<p>
    19. <strong>Terms of buying</strong>: When you buy an RScript Market item you’re doing so on the following terms:
</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
    <li>
        you promise to us and the author that you have carefully considered the suitability of your chosen license, and that you have chosen appropriately;
    </li>
    <li>
        you cannot cancel a completed purchase of an item;
    </li>
    <li>
        we and the authors do not promise that any particular item will continue to be available on RScript Market so you should download and save the item as
        soon as you buy it;
    </li>
    <li>
        once you buy or download an item and the item has been paid for, you acquire a non-exclusive license to use the item under the terms set out in the
        license (non-exclusive means others might also license the same item);
    </li>
    <li>
        the author retains ownership of the item;
    </li>
    <li>
        your relevant details may be provided to the author of the item in order to facilitate the transaction, for example for invoicing and item support
        services;
    </li>
    <li>
        transaction limits may apply to RScript credits (such as total or daily limits);
    </li>
    <li>
        we have the right to enforce against you the terms of the license that you have acquired from an author.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    It is important that you understand the terms on which you are making a purchase. Please take the time to review this section carefully.
</p>
<p>
    20. <strong>Promises we make</strong>:
</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
    <li>
        We promise that the RScript Market site will be suitable for the purposes described on the sites, and that we will provide our platform services with
        reasonable skill and care.
    </li>
    <li>
        We otherwise do not make any express or implied promises about the RScript Market site (or any items on the RScript Market site).
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    21. <strong>Promises authors make</strong>: The author of an item you buy promises you that:
</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
    <li>
        the item is of acceptable quality and fit for the purpose for which it is 'sold';
    </li>
    <li>
        the item matches the description given by the author on the item preview page, as well as any item preview;
    </li>
    <li>
        they will honour any express promises given to you that are not contained in these terms;
    </li>
    <li>
        they have the rights necessary to license that item on the terms of applicable license;
    </li>
    <li>
        your use of that item in accordance with the terms of the applicable license does not infringe the intellectual property rights of someone else;
    </li>
    <li>
        the item and its description are not false, inaccurate, misleading, fraudulent, unlawful or defamatory;
    </li>
    <li>
        the item and its description do not violate any applicable law or regulation (including those governing export control, consumer protection, unfair
        competition, criminal law, pornography, anti-discrimination, trade practices or fair trading);
    </li>
    <li>
        the item does not contain viruses or other computer codes, files or programs which are designed to limit or destroy the functionality of other computer
        software or hardware.
    </li>
    <li>
        if the item is marked as 'supported', they will provide you with the services as outlined in the <u>item support policy</u>.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    This is what authors are promising you when you buy an item.
</p>
<p>
    22. <strong>Taxes</strong>:
</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
    <li>
        Prices and fees are inclusive of transactional taxes where relevant (like VAT and GST), except for the following (which will be added as part of the
        total price buyers see before finalising a purchase): (a) European Union VAT (if applicable) and (b) any other transactional taxes we state on the site
        will be added.
    </li>
    <li>
        You are responsible for paying all other fees and taxes associated with your use of RScript Market wherever levied. Your responsibility includes
        withholding tax if it applies, unless we already process that withholding tax. We may collect geographical location information to determine your
        location, which may be used for tax purposes (so location information you give us must be accurate for tax residency purposes).
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    23. <strong>Items with an incorrect price or incorrect information</strong>: Despite our reasonable efforts, items may occasionally be listed at an
    incorrect price or with incorrect information. If this happens, we may cancel or reverse a transaction, even after it is completed and a payment has been
    processed. If we do this, we’ll promptly arrange for any payment to be credited or refunded and you must not use the item unless you re-purchase it at the
    correct price.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Refunds</strong>
</p>
<p>
    25. Given the nature of digital content, a refund on a purchase is not granted unless one of the promises given by the author in section 21 has been
    breached, or a refund is required under the <a href="https://themeforest.net/page/customer_refund_policy">RScript Market Refund Rules</a> or Australian
    consumer law or other relevant consumer protection laws.
</p>
<p>
    26. We or an author will assess refund requests on their merits, considering the digital nature of RScript Market items and the type of item preview that
    was available before purchase. There is generally no obligation to provide a refund or credit in situations like the following:
</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
    <li>
        you have changed your mind about an item;
    </li>
    <li>
        you bought an item by mistake;
    </li>
    <li>
        you do not have sufficient expertise to use the item;
    </li>
    <li>
        you ask for goodwill; or
    </li>
    <li>
        you can no longer access the item because it has been removed (we advise you to download items as soon as you buy them to avoid this situation).
    </li>
    <li>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    27. If the author or we decide to issue a refund or credit, this will generally be done using the same manner used to make the purchase. So if the item was
    bought using a particular payment method you will be refunded using the same payment method in reverse. Any payment made to you will be made in US Dollars,
    under the rules of the payment method (see <strong>section 18 - </strong><strong>Currency conversion costs</strong> about currency conversion back to your
    local currency).
</p>
<p>
    It is important that you understand how refunds work on RScript Market.
</p>
<p>
    28. <strong>Disputes lodged with payment agents</strong>: If, as a buyer, you lodge a dispute with a payment agent, this will result in a freezing of your
    RScript Market account until the dispute raised with the payment agent has been closed. This makes it very complex to resolve any related issues, and means
    we cannot make payments or issue refunds out of your RScript Market account, so we encourage buyers to contact us directly first to see if we can help
    resolve any concerns.
</p>
<p>
    29. <strong>Fine print</strong>: We are not a bank or licensed deposit taker in the USA or elsewhere, your credits are not deposits under US law about
    banks, and that means you don’t get the benefit of any deposit insurance or guarantee under those laws. We don’t act as a fiduciary or as a trustee for
    you, and we’re not a licensed financial service provider.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Becoming an author</strong>
</p>
<p>
    30. Imagine creating what you want, when you want, from the comfort of your own home, making passive income whether you’re working or not. Some of our
    authors sell stock items in their free time as a hobby, some do it to get their name out there, and some are able to make it their full time profession.
    Remember that if you become an author these terms will continue to apply, along with the Author Terms you’ll sign up to as an author.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Intellectual Property</strong>
</p>
<p>
    31. <strong>What we own</strong>: We own all the <strong>RScript content</strong> that we have put on RScript Market (unless otherwise stated and excluding
    content owned by others). This includes the design, compilation, and look and feel of the RScript Market site, and copyright, trademarks, designs and other
    intellectual property on RScript Market. We own all the trademarks, logos, service marks and trade names on RScript Market (unless otherwise stated and
    excluding these things owned by others). You will not copy, distribute, modify or make derivative works of any of our RScript Content or use any of our
    intellectual property in any way not expressly stated in these terms.
</p>
<p>
    32. <strong>What we don’t own</strong>: We do not own the items on RScript Market; our authors do. So we cannot take responsibility for the quality, safety
    or legality of the items. We do not promise that the items or any member content, code, data or materials available on or via the RScript Market do not
infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party. (Each author provides promises to you directly when you purchase their item – see    <strong>section 21 - Promises authors make</strong>.)
</p>
<p>
    33. <strong>Copyright, trademark and intellectual property claims</strong>: We respect the intellectual property rights of others and we require that
    authors do the same. If you believe that an item or member content infringes an intellectual property right (including copyright) please see the
    information in our <u>Content Policy</u>.
</p>
<p>
    Our Content Policy is where you will find all the information relating to how we treat intellectual property on RScript Market including copyright and
    other rights.
</p>
<p>
    34. <strong>Model and property releases</strong>: Items are available for commercial use (unless stated otherwise by the Author on an item page). Authors
    are responsible for obtaining and keeping a model or property release if one is needed; please ask the author directly if you need a copy of a release.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Our use of your information</strong>
</p>
<p>
    35. <strong>Privacy</strong>: We respect your privacy. When you become a member you will be asked to provide some information about yourself. This
    information may be used by us and contractors in connection with providing the RScript Market sites and their services, including marketing activities.
</p>
<p>
    Our <u>Privacy Policy</u> explains how we deal with your information and it forms part of these terms.
</p>
<p>
    36. <strong>Confidential Information</strong>: We value your information and take reasonable precautions to protect it. While we take reasonable steps to
    preserve the security of your information, please be aware that we can’t promise that your use of the RScript Market will be confidential, and we can’t
    promise that any information you provide to us is perfectly secure. While using the RScript Market, you may also become aware of confidential information
    about us or another member. You promise to not disclose any confidential information made available to you through the RScript Market to any other person.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Playing fair</strong>
</p>
<p>
    37. <strong>Prohibited Conduct</strong>: RScript is founded on the idea of community and like any functioning and healthy community, some things are not
    allowed and will not be tolerated. We aim to take a common sense approach to the general code of conduct on RScript Market but you promise that you will
    not:
</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
    <li>
        use a false email address, impersonate others, or misrepresent your affiliation with others;
    </li>
    <li>
        attempt to gain unauthorised access to computer systems or content through the RScript Market;
    </li>
    <li>
        attempt to contact other members through the RScript Market or use any information gained from the RScript Market with the intention to make a private
        arrangement that would otherwise be made using the RScript Market;
    </li>
    <li>
        enter any arrangements that are not consistent with, or are intended to apply in addition to, these terms or the Author Terms;
    </li>
    <li>
        use information gathered from or through the RScript Market in a way that may confuse or mislead consumers (for example, automatically gathering
        information to set up a site that looks like one of our sites);
    </li>
    <li>
        attempt to or actually interrupt, negatively impact or alter the RScript Market operation in any way;
    </li>
    <li>
        use the RScript Market or any of the content in a way that violates applicable law, that violates the intellectual property or other rights of us or
        others, or that is fraudulent, obscene, unprofessional, offensive, misleading or defamatory;
    </li>
    <li>
        modify, reproduce, display, publish, distribute, copy, transmit, perform, license, create derivative works from, transfer, or sell or re-sell any
        information, content, software, or item obtained from or through the RScript Market, other than in accordance with these terms or the license for the
        item.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    38. We strongly recommend that you don’t make your contact details public on the RScript Market or in any public communications via the RScript Market
    site. Contact details include your email address, street address, Skype name and phone number (but not social network handles). If you do, it must not be
    for any reason prohibited under <strong>section 37(c) - Prohibited Conduct</strong> and you do so at your risk!
</p>
<p>
    39. <strong>Content removal</strong>: We can look at or remove any of your content for any reason at our discretion. Reasons might include quality
    assurance, if we receive a valid copyright take-down notice, if we think that the content is unauthorised, misleading, incorrect, offensive, or in breach
    of anyone else’s rights, or if we think that your use of the RScript Market and any content might result in liability to us or anyone else.
</p>
<p>
    40. <strong>Community participation</strong>: We take great pride in our global and thriving community—it’s part of what makes the RScript Market such a
    friendly place. We focus on transparency and mutual respect and invite you to participate, give feedback and have your say. Before participating on RScript
    Market, please read the <u>Community Guidelines</u>, as you agree to follow them as part of these terms.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Linking; apps made by others</strong>
</p>
<p>
    41. <strong>Linking to the RScript Market</strong>: We’d be delighted if you decide to link to RScript Market from other sites but you have to link to a
    full version of a page and not link directly to an image or file hosted on RScript Market. That includes no "in-line" linking methods resulting in images
    hosted on RScript Market being displayed on other sites. You must not "frame" any RScript Market pages by surrounding those pages with someone else’s
    content, materials or branding. We reserve the right to insist that any link to the RScript Market be discontinued, and to revoke your ability to link to
    the RScript Market.
</p>
<p>
    42. <strong>Links from the RScript Market</strong>: The RScript Market sites may contain links to other non-RScript sites. We have no control or
    responsibility over anything on those sites, and do not endorse or sponsor those sites, even if they are affiliated to us.
</p>
<p>
    43. <strong>Third party developers</strong>: We welcome the contribution of our members and broader community, who offer applications that work with
    RScript Market. You will need to form your own view about these applications and their developers; we’re not able to warrant or endorse those applications
    and disclaim liability relating to these applications.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Legal Housekeeping</strong>
</p>
<p>
    44. <strong>Eligibility, suspension or termination</strong>: Membership is not an automatic right, it is a benefit for community members who follow our
    reasonable rules and treat other community members well. We hope that you will be with us for a long time. But we may, using reasonable discretion, decide
    whether or not your use of RScript Market complies with these terms. We can suspend or terminate your RScript Market account at any time for any reason
    (acting reasonably of course) for any of the following reasons:
</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
    <li>
        if you breach these terms;
    </li>
    <li>
        if you act in a way that does not align with the values of our community; or
    </li>
    <li>
        If you act in a way that could cause us or members harm.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    If we do decide to permanently terminate your RScript Market account you must not apply for a new account as unfortunately you will no longer be welcome in
    our community.
</p>
<p>
    45. <strong>RScript Market</strong>: If an indemnity, limitation or disclaimer of liability, promise or release (a '<strong>benefit</strong>') is given in
    our favour in these terms, the Author Terms or Affiliate Terms, we hold that benefit on trust for the other RScript Market. We may enforce that benefit as
    trustee for and on behalf of the RScript Market as beneficiaries under that trust.
</p>
<p>
    46. We may use the services of another RScript Market to conduct payment or other activities with you, like collecting payments and paying author earnings.
    If you make a Buy Now payment, we receive your payment as a limited agent for the author and your obligation to pay the author is met when we (or another
    RScript Market) receive the payment successfully.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Liability and indemnity - between us and members</strong>
</p>
<p>
    47. We provide the RScript Market site, not the items on the RScript Market site.
</p>
<p>
    48. You indemnify us against all losses, costs (including legal costs on a full indemnity basis), expenses, demands or liability that we incur arising out
    of, or in connection with, a third party claim against us relating to your use of RScript Market and any content you post to RScript Market (including, if
    you are an author, your items).
</p>
<p>
    49. If you are a buyer, you agree that we are not responsible for, and you release us from liability arising out of or in connection with:
</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
    <li>
        the items on RScript Market;
    </li>
    <li>
        information provided by authors about their items (including on any item page); and
    </li>
    <li>
        your use of items from RScript Market.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    50. Our liability to you in connection with RScript Market or these terms, in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, is limited as follows:
</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
    <li>
        we exclude liability for any of these things incurred by you: loss of revenue, loss of profit, loss of goodwill, loss of customers, loss of capital,
        damage to reputation, loss in connection with any other contract, loss of data, or indirect, consequential or special loss, damage or expense; and;
    </li>
    <li>
        our total liability to you is limited to the total buyer fees and author fees paid by you in the 12 months before liability accrued.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    These sections mean that you protect us from costs and claims that happen because of your actions on the site, and that our liability to you is limited.
</p>
<p>
    We may, at our expense, assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter you indemnify us against, and if so you agree to cooperate with us.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Liability and indemnity - between authors and members</strong>
</p>
<p>
    51. Each author grants to each buyer of the author’s items a limited indemnity on the following terms:
</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
    <li>
        if another person makes a claim against a buyer that the buyer's use of the item in accordance with the terms of the applicable license infringes the
        intellectual property or other rights of that third party; and
    </li>
    <li>
        if that buyer promptly notifies the author of the claim and gives the author the option to control the defense of the claim (at the author's cost),
        then the author will indemnify the buyer against damages finally awarded by a court against the buyer or any settlement damages agreed to by the author
        regarding that claim.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    52. The liability of each author to their buyers is otherwise limited, for each item purchased, to the author's earnings from the payment for that item,
    except to the extent that the author's liability arises from wilful misrepresentations made about the item.
</p>
<p>
    This means that the author's liability to buyers is limited.
</p>
<p>
    53. <strong>Availability</strong>: We strive to have the RScript Market available to you 24 hours a day, seven days a week but you know how the internet
    works: occasionally you might not be able to access the RScript Market, and this might happen for any reason, at any time, with or without notice, or at
    our absolute discretion. We might also change aspects of how RScript Market works. The RScript Market will not be liable to you for any loss you suffer as
    a result of these things.
</p>
<p>
    54. <strong>Third Party</strong>: If you're agreeing to these terms on behalf of someone else (like your employer), then you're promising to us that you
    have full legal authority to bind that third party.
</p>
<p>
55. <strong>Consumer laws</strong>: In some places there may be non-excludable warranties, guarantees or other rights ('    <strong>non-excludable consumer guarantees</strong>'). We do not exclude, restrict or modify non-excludable consumer guarantees in these terms. Except for
    non-excludable consumer guarantees, we and authors are bound only by the express promises made in these terms. Our and each author's liability for breach
    of a non-excludable consumer guarantee is limited, at our or the author's option, to replacing or paying the cost of replacing the relevant item or
    service, (unless the non-excludable consumer guarantee says otherwise).
</p>
<p>
    56. <strong>Blocking a member, disabling an account or refusing to process a payment.</strong> We may block you, terminate your account or refuse to
    process a payment if we reasonably believe there is a risk associated with you, your account, or that payment, including if it breaches a law or
    regulation. Examples of where we might do this include transactions where the payment is from or to a person or country sanctioned by an authority (like
    the United Nations, the United States government or the Australian government); or where we reasonably believe there is a legal or regulatory risk or a
    risk of loss being suffered by us or our members. You promise that you are not located in a sanctioned country and are not on a sanctioned persons list. We
    may also block members from a country if we can’t make payments to or from that country. You should check what payment methods are available in your
    country for making payments as a buyer or for withdrawing earnings as an author. We may take any of the actions stated in this section without notice. If
    required by law we may forfeit existing deposits or earnings.
</p>
<p>
    As our sites are global, there are different laws that may apply and these may restrict our relationship with you.
</p>
<p>
    58. <strong>Relationship between the parties:</strong> Nothing in these terms is to be construed as constituting a partnership, joint venture, employment
    or agency relationship between you and us, or between you and any other member. Neither you nor us can bind each other in any way. We are, however, an
    agent of the authors only for the limited purposes of collecting Buy Now payments (see section 46), the authors' providing warranties to buyers in section
    21 - Promises authors make, to limit authors' liability to buyers in section 53, and the disclaimer of authors' liability to buyers in section 56 -
    Consumer laws.
</p>
<p>
    59. <strong>Notices:</strong> Any notice you send us must be submitted via a <u>help request</u>. Any notice we send to you will be emailed to your RScript
    Market account email address.
</p>
<p>
    60. <strong>Changes to RScript Market Terms:</strong> We may change these terms at any time and, if we make changes, we will take reasonable steps to let
    our members know about the changes. You can also keep track of whether changes have been made to our terms by referring to the version and effective date
    at the footer of the terms. You can close your Market Account and terminate your agreement with us at any time if you do not agree to the changes. However,
    if you continue to use the RScript Market site after the changes are made, then you will be agreeing to the changes.
</p>
<p>
    61. <strong>Interpretation:</strong> Words like 'include' and 'including' are not words of limitation and where anything is within our discretion we mean
    our sole discretion.
</p>
<p>
    62. <strong>Applicable Laws:</strong> We control and operate RScript Market from our offices in the USA. The laws of Delaware, USA govern these terms, and
    you submit to the jurisdiction of the courts there for the resolution of any dispute between us.

    <strong>Welcome to Item Support</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Item support is a service provided by many authors on RScript Market. Having support for your purchased item means that the author will be available to
    you, the buyer, to iron-out any potential issues you have in using the item.
</p>
<p>
    This page will tell you all about what you can expect from authors who sell supported items. Here’s a summary:

<p>
    Managing buyer support requests can become quite a task for authors who sell to many buyers. To maintain a sustainable marketplace we’ve set out what is
    and isn’t included in supported items from RScript Market. This helps RScript Market authors spend more time doing what they do best — creating great new
    items and keeping their existing items up-to-date.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Read the item documentation first</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Many support queries and technical questions will already be answered in supporting documentation such as FAQ's and comments from previous buyers. We also
    make sure that all of the items sold on RScript Market have documentation included so always check the included information and if you can’t find the
    answer you’re looking for then consider whether the author might be able to help.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>What's included in item support</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The item support period</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A supported item includes item support for 6 months from the purchase date. During those 6 months, the author is expected to be available to provide the
    item support services we’ve set out on this page. Response times by authors can vary depending on the volume of inquiries, the nature of the request, and
    whether questions have already been answered or support has already been provided (see ‘fair-use’ later on).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Answering questions about how to use the item</strong>
</p>
<p>
    During the item support period, the author is expected to be available to answer your general questions about the item and how to use it. For example, how
    do I get my homepage to look like the one in the preview? The response to this type of question can come in various formats including directing you to an
    already documented response (e.g. in the comments or FAQs).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Answering technical questions about the item (and included third party assets)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    During the item support period the author is expected to be available to:
</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
        Answer your specific questions about the features and functionality of the item
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide some guidance on the way the item is designed
    </li>
    <li>
        Help you with issues related to using the item and getting the most value out of its functionality.
    </li>
    <li>
        Answer questions about third party assets or functionality (e.g. plug-ins) bundled with the item, such as how they work and other technical questions.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Help with defects in the item or included third party assets</strong>
</p>
<p>
    During the item support period, you can report and discuss bugs and minor item defects with the author, and authors are expected to be available to assist
    you with reported bugs. If appropriate, authors may issue bug fixes directly to you as part of item support. (If an author decides to address a bug fix
    through a general version update, that update will be available to all buyers.)
</p>
<p>
    A supported item may include third party functionality or items from other authors such as plugins, image sliders or contact forms. During the item support
    period, the author is expected to be available to assist with questions about third party assets, and to either help you to address particular issues with
    the third party asset or direct you to where you can find the solution.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Item updates to ensure ongoing compatibility and to resolve security vulnerabilities</strong>
</p>
<p>
    If a supported item includes a third party asset (e.g., a plugin), or is intended to work with third party software or platforms (e.g. a CMS), authors are
    expected to ensure the item remains compatible if the software or platform version is updated. This includes if the third party asset has a security
    update. Item updates of this type will generally be delivered as version updates available to all buyers. Choosing a supported item (or upgrading to
    extended support) ensures you’re getting an item that’s backed by the author, and enables our authors to maintain their items in these ways.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>What's not included in item support</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Item customization</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Item support does not include services to modify or extend the item beyond the original features, style and functionality described on the item page. For
    customization services that will help you tailor the item to your specific requirements, we recommend contacting the author to see if they privately offer
    paid customisation services.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Installation of the item</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Buyers have varying levels of experience with different software platforms and technologies and getting your item up and running can depend on many
    variables that are specific to your circumstances. You’ll need to have a working knowledge of the software platforms and technologies for which items are
    created, so item support does not include help to install the item on your server or on a CMS. If you’re just starting out or skilling up, try a course or
    tutorial on RScript Market Tuts+. If you’re after installation services, you can ask the authors if they privately offer paid installation services.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Hosting, server environment, or software</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Authors are not required to support issues about your web hosting or server environment, or issues with the software you’ve got installed on your machine
    to use the item. Please check your ISP/web hosting provider or other software documentation that you’re trying to use to help solve your issues.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Help from authors of included third party assets</strong>
</p>
<p>
    If a supported item includes a third party asset (e.g. a plugin or slider), the <strong>author of the third party asset</strong> is not required to provide
    support for that asset to buyers of the supported item. Direct your questions about third party assets to the author of the item you purchased.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>What’s included in all item purchases</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Updates to ensure the item works as described and is protected against major security concerns</strong>
</p>
<p>
    All items on RScript Market should work as described by the author (in the preview, screenshots, item description, etc.) and be protected from major
    security issues. Security issues are assessed by the impact they have on the buyer and their users. Examples of major security issues are site
    administration takeover, the ability to use the site against other sites, and breaches of private data.
</p>
<p>
    In the instance that there is something wrong with the item and you are expecting an update; depending on the type of update, it can take several
    days/weeks to properly fix, test, review and release.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Included version updates for all items</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In addition to updating an item to keep it working as described or to fix major security issues, authors of all items may from time to time and at their
    discretion, provide other updates to improve or modify the functionality of an item or fix other minor issues. Generally, authors of supported items will
    provide this type of updates more frequently to keep their items up to date for sale. In all instances, the new version of the item will automatically be
    made available to previous buyers through the Downloads page.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Fair-use, and other details</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We believe an author’s time is best spent using their amazing creative and technical skills to build great new items and keep their existing items
    up-to-date. We have outlined what item support is all about and we ask that you’re mindful of the author’s time when making item support requests. We
    suggest that before you ask an author for support, read the documentation (included with the downloaded item) and any additional information available on
    the item pages (FAQs, Comments, etc.) to see if that information answers your questions.
</p>
<p>
    Most authors sell their items to many buyers, so the time taken to respond to your request can vary. If you’re waiting for an update or fix to an item, it
    may take several days/weeks for an author to properly fix, test, review and release. Authors can also take breaks (e.g. a vacation) from providing item
    support. Authors will let you know of any extended breaks via the Support and Comments tabs on their items.

    <strong>RScript Market Content Policy</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In this article you will find important information regarding RScript Market copyright and intellectual property policy and Membership Terms, vital to both
    RScript Market Authors and Buyers.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Introduction</strong>
</p>
<p>
    At RScript Market we want to help people earn and learn online. We respect our community and we respect intellectual property. We insist that people using
    RScript Market respect intellectual property too.
</p>
<p>
    We've put this guide together for two main reasons - to help you know what to do if you:
</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
        suspect that content is being used without permission; or
    </li>
    <li>
        receive a claim from someone else asserting that you are using content without permission.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We use the word 'content' to describe anything that's been created as an original work.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>How is content protected?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    It doesn't matter whether the creator is a company or an individual - creators of original content have legal rights over their content and content can't
    be used without the creator's permission.
</p>
<p>
    Content you see online is usually protected by one or more intellectual property rights (IPRs). IPRs include copyright, trademarks, designs and patents.
</p>
<p>
    Although different countries have different details in their IPR laws, generally the main purpose of all IPR laws is to give creators of original content
    exclusive rights to use their content and the right to take legal action against those who use it without their permission.
</p>
<p>
    IPRs are economic rights - you can buy and sell your 'property' to make money, and you can take legal action for unauthorised use and claim money in
    damages. In some countries, content creators might also have moral rights such as the right to be identified as the creator and the right to stop your
    content being used in a derogatory way. And in some places people also have more personal rights to control images of themselves, under rights of privacy
    and publicity.
</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
        <strong>Copyright </strong>
        gives the creator of original content the exclusive rights to use and exploit that content. The rights usually start on creation and can be licensed or
        assigned. Depending on where you live, you don't always have to formally register your copyright.
    </li>
    <li>
        A <strong>trademark </strong>gives a person exclusive rights to use a particular phrase, name or logo if these are being used to set products or
        services apart from those provided by others. These rights are often registered.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    You can read more about IPRs on country specific information here:

</ul>
<p>
    We have also developed the <strong><u>RScript Market and Intellectual Property</u></strong> resource which you should read if you’re joining our RScript
    Market community.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>What if you think your content's being used without your permission?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Consider whether you wish to contact the author (sellers of items) whom you think might be breaching your intellectual property. There may be a
    misunderstanding that you and the author might be able to sort out without resorting to the formal processes outlined below.
</p>
<p>
    In any case, consider keeping screenshots of any activity that concerns you so you've got the details recorded.
</p>
<p>
    There are two main ways to let us know if you think your content is being used without permission:
</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
        for copyright owners - the DMCA takedown notice process;
    </li>
    <li>
        for other IPR owners, including trademark owners - the general IPR notice process.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>If you're a copyright owner the DMCA takedown notice process applies.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    If you believe someone is using your copyright content without permission, you can use the <em>Digital Millenium Copyright Act</em> (DMCA) process by
    sending us a DMCA takedown notice. We act promptly when we receive valid DMCA takedown notices. Although the DMCA is US law, and we're in Australia, we
    follow the DMCA rules.
</p>
<p>
    Please make sure you understand what rights you are claiming before you submit a DMCA takedown notice because it is a serious legal document. Consider
    whether you need legal advice. It's really important not to make false claims as this could have serious legal consequences.
</p>
<p>
    You'll need to prepare one document that:
</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
    <li>
Tells us about the content that you claim infringes your copyright, including a description and where we can find it -        <strong><em>include the URL</em></strong>;
    </li>
    <li>
        Tells us about your copyrighted content and let us know where we can see this published - <strong><em>include the URL</em></strong>;
    </li>
    <li>
        Gives us a detailed explanation about how you believe the content violates your copyright;
    </li>
    <li>
        Includes your full name and contact details, including your address, phone number and email address;
    </li>
    <li>
        Includes the following two statements:
    </li>
</ol>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
        <em>
            "I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above as allegedly infringing is not authorized by the copyright owner,
            its agent, or the law."
        </em>
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>
            "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act
            on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed."
        </em>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
By law, you need to sign and date your notice. If you send us the information via    <a href="https://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/requests/new"><strong>RScript Market Help</strong></a> please note that by entering your full name you are
    providing us with your digital signature which is legally binding. If you want to sign a physical document you'll need to scan the document and attach it
    to the help ticket.
</p>
<p>
    We have to send this DMCA takedown notice to the other person, which means your details will be passed to them. The other person can submit a DMCA
    counter-notification if they disagree with your DMCA takedown notice and they might contact you directly using your contact details.
</p>
<p>
    The content in question will generally be disabled from the RScript Market when we receive a DMCA takedown notice so we recommend that before you issue a
    DMCA notice, you screenshot any relevant pages including the member page and relevant site pages for your records. If we receive a counter-notification and
    you don't confirm you've taken legal action against the other person within 10 business days, we will re-enable the content.
</p>
<p>
    If you have any further questions please contact us.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>If you're the owner of another kind of IPR - the general IPR notice process applies.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    As the DMCA process only applies to copyright, we have a similar process for other claims (general IPR notices). If you believe that someone is using
    content that is protected by another form of IPR, such as a trademark, we ask you to send us a general IPR notice that contains detailed information about
    your claim. The notice needs to:
</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
    <li>
Tell us about the content that you claim infringes your rights, including a description and where we can find it -        <strong><em>include the URL</em></strong>;
    </li>
    <li>
Tell us about the rights you claim, the basis of the ownership claim, and where we can see evidence of your right -<strong><em>include the URL</em></strong>.        <em>If you're claiming a trademark right include the trademark registration number, country and class of registration</em>;
    </li>
    <li>
        Give us a detailed explanation about how you believe the content violates your claimed right; and
    </li>
    <li>
        Include your full name and contact details, including address, phone number and email address.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    You need to sign and date your notice. If you send us the information via <strong><u>RScript Market Help</u></strong> please note that by entering your
    full name you are providing us with your digital signature which is legally binding. If you want to sign a physical document you'll need to scan the
    document and attach it to the help ticket.

    We will respond appropriately depending on what your claim is about. We may ask for more information and send a copy of your claim to the other person.
    That person might contact you directly using the details you've provided.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>What can you do if you've been sent a notice?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The easiest way to avoid being at the receiving end of a complaint or DMCA takedown notice is to avoid using content that belongs to others. If you don't
    know whether you have a right to use something - please don't use it on RScript Market or give it to others via our Market.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>If you've been sent a DMCA takedown notice:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    If you receive a DMCA takedown notice you can consider whether you think the claims made in the notice are valid. You might choose to seek legal advice,
    especially if you're not sure whether there is any legal validity to the claim.
</p>
<p>
    You can choose to accept a DMCA takedown notice - if so your content will be taken down and remain disabled. Or, you can choose to respond to a DMCA
    takedown notice by sending us a DMCA counter-notification which:
</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
    <li>
        Tells us about the content that has been taken down, including a description and where it was found - <strong><em>include the URL</em></strong> (this
        is on the original DMCA notice).
    </li>
    <li>
        Makes a formal statement about why you think the content should be reinstated. Include the following words: “I make this statement under penalty of
        perjury, I have a good faith belief that the content was. [add the reason why the content was not used in an unauthorized way]” (for example “removed
        or disabled as a result of mistake or mis-identification of the content”.
    </li>
    <li>
        Includes your full name and contact details, including your address, phone number and email address.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you are a US resident, includes a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district where you live.
        If you live outside the United States, includes a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the courts in Delaware, USA (where RScript Market
        is based), and the courts located in the United States federal district in which the person who sent the DMCA takedown notice (claimant) lives.
        Includes a statement that you will accept service of process from the claimant, or their agent.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    By law, you need to sign and date your notice. If you send us the information via <strong><u>RScript Market Help</u></strong> please note that by entering
    your full name you are providing us with your digital signature which is legally binding. If you want to sign a physical document you'll need to scan the
    document and attach it to the help ticket.
</p>
<p>
    We'll send a copy of the DMCA counter-notification to the person who sent the DMCA takedown notice (claimant), then wait 10 business days. Unless the
    claimant sends us a notice that court proceedings have been filed against you within the 10 days, we'll then reinstate the content within 14 business days
    from when we received the counter-notification.
</p>
<p>
    Please take care to understand this process because it is possible that the claimant can take legal action against you if you file a counter-notification.
    If you have any further questions please contact us.
</p>
<p>
    It's really important not to make a false claim, as this could have serious legal consequences. Please seek your own advice if you're not sure about what
    the counter-notification process means.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>If you've been sent a general IPR notice, or another type of complaint has been made about your content:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Complaints about the use of IPRs can cover a wide range of issues.
</p>
<p>
    If we send you a general IPR notice, or tell you that another type of complaint has been made, we'll generally ask you some specific questions about the
    complaint and the content or let you know what else is needed.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>How else could you try to resolve the issue with a person who has sent a notice or made a complaint?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    You can always consider contacting the claimant to discuss and resolve the issue directly using the contact details they provide on the DMCA takedown
    notice or general IPR notice.
</p>
<p>
    We are unable to give specific advice about IPR claims, but factors that you could consider raising with the claimant could include:
</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
        Whether the content was independently created, the dates of creation of your and the claimant's work, and other copyright law issues such as whether
        any defences apply.
    </li>
    <li>
        Whether the claimant's work has the same scope as your content. Alternatively, whether it is just one component of your content (e.g. a graphic within
        a website template) and can be removed from your content.
    </li>
    <li>
        Whether the claimant is seeking monetary payment from you, or simply to have your content taken down permanently. If monetary payment is claimed,
        relevant factors include earnings from the sale of the content, whether a licensing fee might be appropriate, and how the claimant's work was used.
    </li>
    <li>
        Where you and the claimant live, and relevant legal forums for resolving disputes.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>What's our role?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    When we receive claims about unauthorised use of content on RScript Market, depending on the circumstances and who has made the claim, we can apply the
    DMCA law and our processes for other content as already explained.
</p>
<p>
    We will always try to work with everyone involved fairly and in the spirit of our community. Unfortunately, we can't help you by giving you legal advice.
    We can't make legally binding judgments either as we are not a court of law!
</p>
<p>
    We may check content submitted (e.g. RScript Market items) for quality purposes, and while doing so we may identify potential issues with the rights of
    others, or potential violations of our terms. If this happens we may notify the person submitting the content and let them know that there could be an
    issue with it. But we are not obliged to review content for intellectual property or other legal matters.
</p>
<p>
    It’s for this reason that you should not assume that we will check content for the existence or ownership of copyright. If we’ve accepted content, it does
    not mean that we have checked and cleared copyright or other intellectual property rights.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Violations</strong>
</p>
<p>
    As you'll know, serious consequences can flow from IPR infringement including legal action against infringers. <strong><u>RScript Market Terms</u></strong>
    prohibit unauthorised use of content by anyone who uses our platform.
</p>
<p>
    If you're an RScript Market user and you receive more than one valid DMCA takedown notice (and do not submit any valid DMCA counter-notifications), or we
    think that you're acting in breach of RScript Market Market terms, we can disable your account.
</p>
<p>
    Other violations like the following may also result in your account being disabled:
</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
        Uploading an item that is the output of a tutorial.
    </li>
    <li>
        Submitting items that are not your own creation or that contain component assets that are not yours and that have not been properly licensed or sourced
        (this includes for use in item previews).
    </li>
</ul>

    <strong>Community Rules</strong>
</p>
<p>
    RScript Market is a community of creatives who come together to share ideas and help each other succeed.
</p>
<p>
    We invite you to join in, but do have a few rules. The rules and values below exist to help you understand what it means to be a member of the community
    and cover all aspects of community interaction on RScript Market forums, blogs, contests and events. We're committed to upholding them, and we hope you
    will be too.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>We believe when the community succeeds, we succeed.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We love healthy competition, but feel we're all better off when we're sharing ideas, knowledge and skills and helping one another. We come to give back,
    not shamelessly self-promote.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>We're a global community of many types of people.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We are from all corners of the earth and a glorious melting pot of creative fields, skill levels, cultures, religions and more. We think the opportunity
    for anyone to achieve success no matter where they come from leads to a more meritocratic and equal world.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>We celebrate individuality and embrace diversity.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We encourage different viewpoints as long as they're presented in a way that's constructive and respectful. Personal attacks as well as any behavior that
    is hateful or offensive based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, gender or sexual orientation are not okay.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>We're excited about and inspired by collaboration.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    By collaborating with people from different backgrounds, we are exposed to new ideas and perspectives that fuel the creative process and innovation.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>We're always learning because we're hungry and curious.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We're all students and teachers. Our world moves super fast and we stay ahead of the pack by pushing and pulling each other forward. We don't follow the
    trends, we make them.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>We follow a few hard rules. Please DON’T:</strong>
</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
        Participate in or encourage personal attacks, call out another user and/or sabotage a user’s item.
    </li>
    <li>
        Discuss politics or religion.
    </li>
    <li>
        Spam.
    </li>
    <li>
        Troll or flame.
    </li>
    <li>
        Self-promote.
    </li>
    <li>
        Solicit for any kind of material support, donations, aid, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
        Discuss pricing of items/services in an author-driven pricing category or on Studio.
    </li>
    <li>
        Talk about or link to piracy, warez, illegal activity of any kind, or competitor sites or items.
    </li>
    <li>
        Request or post personal (or identifying) information about any user or any other person.
    </li>
    <li>
        Post anything that would infringe on another person’s intellectual property rights.
    </li>
    <li>
        The forums are not a job board and we would like to help customers within our RScript Market offerings. So, you are welcome to post links to your
        Market profile, item, or Studio profile. Posts requesting contacting outside of RScript Market (email, Skype etc.) will be removed.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Community moderation by the community</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Our forums are designed so that the community plays a large role in their moderation. Forum tools enable the community to determine where the awesome
    content is and what content doesn't belong. The power is in your hands so please use these tools to improve your experience as well the experience of the
    entire community.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Our moderation approach</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We can’t, and don’t, review all posts on the forum. We don’t authorise any posts and we aren’t responsible for their content (including text, images, and
    any external links). Every community forum user is responsible for their own posts - please be mindful of your words and please think carefully about what
    you post.
</p>
<p>
    Actions against our community rules may lead to deletion of your posts, comments, contest submissions or account with or without warning. We won't edit
    posts or comments; even if only part is a problem, the whole thing may be removed. All actions and decisions taken by our moderators are final.
</p>
<p>
    We reserve the right to remove, ban, suspend or block an account as we see fit. RScript Market may terminate your access to the forums at any time, with or
    without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>And to keep our lawyers happy</strong>
</p>
<p>
    To post on the community forum you have to be an RScript Market member, and 13 years or older. We don’t knowingly collect any information from anyone aged
    13 or under.
</p>
<p>
    We may update these guidelines and recommend you check back once in a while. If you don’t agree with these guidelines and the terms of our Privacy Policy,
    we won’t take it personally, but it means that the RScript Market community might not be for you.
</p>
<p>
    You represent and warrant that (i) your use of the forums will follow these guidelines and our Privacy Policy and comply with all applicable laws and
    regulations (including without limitation any local laws or regulations that apply to you) and (ii) your use of the forums will not infringe or
    misappropriate the intellectual property rights of any third party.

    <strong>RScript Market and Intellectual Property</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Introduction</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This article pulls together a whole suite of resources available to you to understand intellectual property (IP).
</p>
<p>
    Although we’re not IP police we do respect the intellectual property of others and expect that you do the same. This article is aimed at helping you to
    respect the copyright and IP of others, as you’d probably want the same respect shown to your items!
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The basics</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Intellectual property is a complex area of the law and covers a whole range of things like copyright, trademarks, design, patents, design and moral rights
    among others! There are many misconceptions surrounding the use of works which are protected by intellectual property rights.
</p>
<p>
    As an RScript Market author, your main intellectual property areas to understand will probably be copyright and trademarks. To get a feel for what
    copyright is and how copyright can be infringed check out our <strong>Copyright article</strong>. If you’re unsure about trademarks and logos head across
    to the <strong>Trademarks article</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    We’ve also prepared a specific article about what assets you can use in your items which covers off on how to license assets for your items, and some
    creative commons and open source questions.
</p>
<p>
    What’s left to say? On topic but not directly related to intellectual property is our RScript originality threshold. So all else equal, your items still
    need to be original and creative enough to make it past our reviewers and onto RScript Market.
</p>
<p>
    If you still have any questions revisit the resources linked in this article and if that doesn’t help open <strong>Help</strong> and we’ll be glad to help.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Getting up to speed</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Here is a list of the IP resources (and links) available to you:
</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
        <u>Content Policy</u>
        – basically the IP rules we abide by on our RScript Market.

        your options are and how to file a counter notification.

    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Miscellaneous</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Beside all the great resources we’ve listed, there are two areas that are worth noting but don’t really fit anywhere else! They are:
</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
    <li>
        Decompiling: You’re not allowed to submit an item that has been decompiled or otherwise reconstructed from another work (even if that work is your
        own). For example: You cannot decompile a Flash file and resell it. Unfortunately, we are unable to tell the origins of a decompiled file and apply a
        general rule that if a work looks as though it is decompiled (even if the work from which it is decompiled is your own) we will reject it because of
        the risk of it being an unauthorized decompilation. If it is your own work you should be able to recreate it.
    </li>
    <li>
        Government or military property: You’re not allowed to submit an item that uses in whole or in part government or military property. You cannot submit
        a work that contains a reproduction of an existing coat of arms, Government seal or military insignia. This restriction does not apply to coats of
        arms, seals or insignia which you have created.
